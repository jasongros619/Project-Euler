These are my 100+ solutions to problems from https://projecteuler.net/.

I found out about Project Euler from several of my friends who are CCS computing majors. I found the site interesting and was inspired to see how many problems I could solve. Some of the problems are especially interesting to me because of how they require me to think of an efficient algorithm to solve them in an efficent manner. I find thinking about how to efficiently do something very interesting.
