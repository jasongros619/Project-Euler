The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
1*1 + 2*2 + ... + 10*10 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10) ^ 2 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
