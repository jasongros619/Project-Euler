Summary:
Suppose you have the fraction like 49/98 where you can simplify it
by removing the same digit in the numerator and the denominator,
49/98 = 4/8 = 1/2 which you get by cancelling out the 9's

There are 4 non-trivial examples, ignoring fractions like 30/50 containing
2 digits in both the numerator and denominator and less than 1.

What is the denominator of the product of the fractions, in simplest form?
"""
#For digits, n,x,y, the only nontrivial cases of canceling happening is
# (10x + n)/(10n + y) = x/y.
#Solving for n, n = 9xy / (10x - y) and  0 < x,y < 10

        if n * (10*x - y) == 9*x*y and x!=y and n < 10:
